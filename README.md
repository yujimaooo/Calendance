🎵 Calendance — Dance Practice Tracker

This app is designed for dancers to track classes, analyze progress and stay motivated.


📌 Overview

Calendance is a mobile application designed for dancers to log their dance classes, track their progress through charts and analytics, and store practice videos and notes. The app features an intuitive calendar-based UI, a streamlined upload workflow, and a visual analytics dashboard. At this stage it's just a MVP but i will look into integrations with Apple Health to import workout data (i.e. dance workouts) and supports Spotify connection for attaching music to each dance record.
